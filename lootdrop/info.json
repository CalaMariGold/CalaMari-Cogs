    "install_msg": "Thanks for installing LootDrop! Get started with `[p]lootdrop set addchannel` to configure channels, then `[p]lootdrop set toggle` to enable drops.\n\nNotes:\n- Uses Config to store user stats and settings\n- Moderate memory usage for tracking active drops and streaks\n- Requires bank to be registered (`[p]bank register`)\n- Requires manage_messages permission for button interactions\n\nUse `[p]help Lootdrop` for all commands.",
